# An Analysis of Stock Market Data

## Overview of Project
A fictional character, Steve, has requested help to analyze his parent's recent stock purchase. They purchased shares of DAQO New Energy Corporation (DQ); however, did no market research before making their decision. This project will analyze the performance of other stocks to determine if his parent's purchase was a wise financial decision based on each stock's annual return and daily volume. His parents want to include data from the entire stock market over the last few years, so the original VBA code built for Steve to analyze a small set of Green Energy stocks will need to be refactored to run faster.

### Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to become comfortable coding in Excel VBA and practicing to solve a problem with multiple solutions. There are many different ways to solve a problem, but some are more optimized and run faster than others. By timing the execution of our original code with nested for loops against our refactored code, we can see that adding arrays and other improvements significantly reduced the run time of the refactored code. Refactoring other developer's code is also an important skill to practice because it makes you comfortable reading and working with code in a different format or approach that you may typically write. 

The following VBA methods were used to solve the challenge: 

1. Creating Macros
2. Conditional Logic
3. Nested For Loops
4. Refactoring Code
5. User Form Design (Inputs, Message Boxes, Buttons)

## Results


### Original Code

![VBA_Output](../main/Resources/VBA_Challenge_Output.png)


I ran the code two seperate times to analyze stock market data from 2017 and 2018. The recorded run times for each year's data are below:

### Refactored Code


I ran the final refactored code two seperate times to analyze stock market data from 2017 and 2018. The recorded run times for each year's data are below:
